Geographic price analysis of flashare accommodation in Sydney, Australia

I had just arrived to Sydney and I was looking for accommodation. I didn't know the city so I gathered information and calculate some metrics to try to detect some opportunities.

To do so I:
- created a hard-code classifier to detected flats available for couples (done)
- Visualize metrics in a map (Shapes extracted from https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files)
- Extract prices when differenciable in text for couples or individuals (in process)
- Apply an anomaly detection algorithm to extract opportunities (pending)
